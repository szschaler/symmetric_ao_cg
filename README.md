# Symmetric Aspect Orientation for Code Generation

This repository contains code from an extension to [EGL](http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/egl/) supporting aspect-oriented modular organisation of code generators. More details are in [this paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2068776.2068782). Some more examples etc. can be found from [this page of additional materials](http://www.steffen-zschaler.de/publications/symmetric_ao_cg/).

The code in this repository is meant to be a starting point for a full integration with EGX.
